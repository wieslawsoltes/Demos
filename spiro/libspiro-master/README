LibSpiro is a shared library designed to give programs the ability to create
smooth continuous curves based on a given set of codes and X,Y constraints.

The main user(s) of Libspiro are Font editing programs such as FontForge,
and forked copies have been seen in more artistic programs such as InkScape,
or in libraries such as GEGL. There may be other possible uses in future,
and this library has strong potential in graphical and vector type programs.

Developers interested in also sharing and making use of LibSpiro will likely
want to read (in this order to understand LibSpiro better):
README-RaphLevien
README-GeorgeWilliams

There is a large amount of information and math on RaphLevien's website for
developers interested in how LibSpiro works.

Developers interested in example programs, can take a look at spiro.c found
within FontForge, InkScape, GEGL and call-test.c included with this library.

Installation
============

Installing from Git master requires 2 preparatory steps:

First, you need to create the `configure' script if you do not have it yet.
This will require autoreconf and automake to build `configure'.
> autoreconf -i
> automake --foreign -Wall


Second, you then use the usual steps to compile it.
Various operating systems and setups will need `configure' options set.
The INSTALLATION file has detailed info for `configure' options.
Example install steps for Linux, FreeBSD, Win32/64 are shown below:

Installing on Linux
> ./configure
> make
> make check
> sudo make install

Installing on FreeBSD10 (using clang3.3 or 3.6)
> ./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/BUILD
> make clean
> make
> make install

Installing on Windows 32-bit
> ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=$(pwd)/build-w32
> make clean
> make
> make install

Installing on Windows 64-bit
> ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --prefix=$(pwd)/build-w64
> make clean
> make
> make install
